"6618","1993-09-22","Topics of The Times; Capitol Games    Last January, following the Republican gain of 10 seats in the 1992 elections, House Democrats awarded themselves five more votes that are essentially meaningless. The new votes went to the four previously non-voting delegates -- from the District of Columbia, Guam, the Virgin Islands and American Samoa -- and the resident commissioner from Puerto Rico. It was a shameless display of majority muscle, meant primarily to mollify Washington D.C. residents who want statehood and real representation but aren't getting either anytime soon.   The new arrangement lets delegates vote when the House meets as a ""committee of the whole"" to do most of its legislating. But if anything is decided by a margin so narrow that delegate votes made the difference, another vote would follow automatically without the delegates.",0.0256410256410256
