KIRK, 85, PASSED AWAY AT HIS CORAL GABLES, FL HOME ON MARCH 24. FROM 1980, 1999 KIRK SERVED AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHAIRMAN OF AMERICAN BANKERS INSURANCE GROUP, WHICH WAS ACQUIRED BY ASSURANT. HE WAS A LEADER, A MENTOR, A HUMANIST, A PHILANTHROPIST AND A GREAT FRIEND TO ALL. KNOWN FOR HIS STRAIGHT TALK AND HIS EXEMPLARY LEADERSHIP, KIRK CREATED A PEOPLE, FOCUSED CULTURE AT THE COMPANY THAT CONTINUES ON TO THIS DAY. AFTER RETIRING IN 1999, KIRK BECAME A FULL, TIME PHILANTHROPIST AND ADVOCATE FOR EDUCATIONAL, CIVIC AND CULTURAL CAUSES. HIS GENEROUS SPIRIT AND PHILANTHROPIC ARM REACHED FAR INTO THE COMMUNITIES OF SOUTH FLORIDA. IN 2011, THE MIAMI TRANSPLANT INSTITUTE HONORED HIM WITH ITS HUMANITARIAN AWARD. HIS GENEROUS SPIRIT AND PRESENCE IN THE COMMUNITY AND AT ASSURANT WILL BE MISSED. WE ARE GRATEFUL TO HAVE WORKED WITH HIM AND BENEFITED FROM HIS LEADERSHIP. OUR THOUGHTS AND DEEPEST SYMPATHIES ARE WITH HIS LOVED ONES, HIS CHILDREN KATHLEEN STALEY AND CHRIS LANDON, HIS GRANDCHILDREN KIRK STALEY, ANGELA AND ROBERT SPEARS, AND HIS PARTNER OF EIGHTEEN YEARS, PAM GARRISON. 1",0.203703703703704
