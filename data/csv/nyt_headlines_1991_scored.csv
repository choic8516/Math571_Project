But on Sunday evening, it performed an equally important service by reviving three string quartets that are neither established oldies nor spanking new. The quartets, composed between 1977 and 1983, proved to be the kind of rigorous, concentrated scores that reward repeated listening. They benefited from powerful, precise readings by the violinists Benjamin Hudson and Carol Zeavin, the violist Lois Martin and the cellist Joshua Gordon.",0.15
