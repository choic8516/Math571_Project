"534","1994-01-22","RESULTS PLUS N.B.A. Kukoc Shocks Pacers  Toni Kukoc banked in a 3-pointer at the buzzer last night as the Chicago Bulls pulled off their 16th straight home victory, 96-95, over the Indiana Pacers. Reggie Miller's jumper with 0.8 seconds left gave the Pacers a 95-93 lead and, presumably, the victory. Miller even bowed to the crowd after a timeout was called. But Scottie Pippen lofted a cross-court pass to Kukoc, who launched the shot over Derrick McKey. (AP) Sonics 91, Mavericks 87: Sam Perkins scored 8 points during an 18-2 run in the third quarter as Seattle overcame a sluggish start to extend Dallas's National Basketball Association-record home-court losing streak to 19 games. (AP) Bucks 113, Hornets 110: Milwaukee got 20 points each from Vin Baker, Eric Murdock and Frank Brickowski, and the host Bucks overcame an 18-point deficit to beat Charlotte. (AP) Pistons 118, Heat 98: The sharpshooting of Joe Dumars and Terry Mills helped Detroit snap its 14-game losing streak as the visiting Pistons beat Miami, which lost its seventh in a row. Dumars scored 35 points and Mills 34. (AP) Celtics 124, Warriors 116: Boston won a season-high fourth straight game after losing 13 of its previous 15, beating visiting Golden State. (AP) Jazz 112, Kings 83: Jeff Malone made seven of his nine shots in the decisive third period, sparking Utah to victory over Sacramento. (AP) BOBSLEDDING Last U.S. Spot Filled  Randy Will of Binghamton, N.Y., drove his sled to victory in the final trial yesterday in Calgary, Alberta, to secure the last of the United States Bobsled Federation's three berths in next month's Winter Olympics. Brian Shimer of Naples, Fla., won the four-day trials and his sled was designated as USA-1. Jim Herberich of Winchester, Mass., is USA-2. (AP) YACHT RACING Tokio Keeps Its Lead  Tokio maintained a narrow lead yesterday with less than 24 hours to go in the third leg of the Whitbread Round the World Race. Tokio, a Whitbread 60 Class yacht skippered by Chris Dickson, was reported 208 nautical miles from the finish line at Auckland, New Zealand. The Maxi-class New Zealand Endeavor was only three miles behind, while five other boats remained in contention. (AP)",0.00884955752212389

West, 33, gives the Pistons a legitimate center, something they lacked all season. The Suns are close to signing free agent Danny Manning, making West expendable. At .592, West is the National Basketball Association's all-time field goal percentage leader among active players, second to Artis Gilmore's .599 on the all-time list. And with 501 consecutive games played, he trails only A. C. Green among active players. (AP)",0.0666666666666667
