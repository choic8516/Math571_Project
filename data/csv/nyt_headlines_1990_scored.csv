Our trans-Atlantic dinner started with papaya and fresh seafood salad featuring lobster, shrimp and king prawns. For the entree we had a choice of roast chicken breast, grilled fillet of salmon or a plate of cold roast beef and cracked-wheat salad. We finished with a goodly chunk of Stilton cheese.
