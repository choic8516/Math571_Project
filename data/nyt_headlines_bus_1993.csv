"9966","THE ECONOMY: PROBLEMS AND REMEDIES UNEVEN RECOVERY The Pacific UNEMPLOYMENT: 8.9% Declines in the aerospace, banking, real estate and entertainment industries have taken the bloom off the California perennial. And environmental regulation, traffic congestion and land-use restrictions may slow growth for a long time. The Mountains and Southwest  UNEMPLOYMNET: 6.6% This diversified economy has proved better equipped than most to weather the recession. Now it has a chance to pick off the high-technology plums from California, whose problems have left some businesses disillusioned. ""UNEVEN RECOVERY"" Trouble on Two Coasts A slow, unbalanced recovery means hard times for California and the Northeast, along with stagnating living standards across the nation. While regional disparities are common, the strains of adjustment are particularly acute this time. By January, when the national unemployment rate had fallen to 7.1 percent, two of the regions below had jobless rates that were considerably higher. And that spells big trouble for Washington, which must reconcile pressures to get the sluggards moving without overheating the economy as a whole. ""UNEMPLOYMENT"" Regional rates in January. The Midwest UNEMPLOYMENT: 6.2% The rust belt wasn't invited to the economic party of the 1980's. But by missing the real-estate boom, it escaped the hangover afflicting other regions. Slimmed-down manufacturers are benefiting from export growth. The South UNEMPLOYMENT: 6.8% Low wages and pro-business governments give the region an edge in attracting cost-conscious industry. But much of the South still lacks a highly-skilled work force. And the suburban sprawls of Florida and Texas are feeling the strains of pollution and congestion. The Northeast UNEMPLOYMENT: 7.9% The Northeast has had many problems in common with California. Connecticut is undergoing the agony of military procurement cutbacks; Massachusetts is suffering from shakeouts in the computer industry and in banking. Increased profits at banks and on Wall Street are beginning to help New York, but the region's old industrial cities may never regain their former vibrancy. ""STAGNANT LIVING STANDARDS"" Income Has Eroded Americans enjoy the highest living standard in the world. But for the past two decades, pay has slid, and more Americans households have had to have two income earners to produce even modest gains in family incomes.
