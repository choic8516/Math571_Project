"41052","BUSINESS SUMMARY FRONT PAGE SQN##386090##STOCKS PLUNGE IN A SELLING SURGE, SWAMPING RALLY Riding one of the most powerful rallies in their history, the stock and bond markets stumbled badly yesterday in one of the busiest trading days ever, raising the specter in some quarters of what Wall Street calls a correction -- a sharp retreat in stock and bond prices. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 57.41 points to 4,628.87. SQN##392480##THE HIGHER THEY RISE, THE HARDER . . .  Yesterday's 35.66-point drop in the Nasdaq composite index, which is dominated by technology stocks, was the second worst in the index's history, measured in points, exceeded only by the 46.12-point decline on Oct. 19, 1987. But at the low point yesterday, the decline exceeded the 1987 number. Since closing Monday at 1,005.89, its first-ever finish above 1,000, the index has fallen 53.02 points, or 5.3 percent, to 952.87. SQN##385913##GREENSPAN SAYS ECONOMY'S LOW MAY BE PAST Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, gave a favorable portrayal of the economy's health to a House panel today, which some traders in the financial markets viewed as making further interest-rate cuts unlikely soon. SQN##388963##CREDITORS IN A BIG PONZI SCHEME SAY THEY'VE BEEN TAKEN AGAIN Thousands of creditors of the Towers Financial Corporation, who lost hundreds of millions of dollars in what regulators have called the largest Ponzi scheme ever, are saying they have been taken again. And, they contend, it happened right under the noses of a battalion of high-priced lawyers and financial advisers hired to help the creditors recover their money. BUSINESS DIGEST SQN##389900##FORD CITES ECONOMY FOR DECLINE IN EARNINGS Ford reported its first quarterly decline in profit in more than two years, as its second-quarter earnings fell 8.1 percent, to $1.57 billion, or $1.45 a share. The company attributed the decline to a softening economy and a weak dollar. It warned that the next quarter was also likely to be weak as it writes off new factory equipment and reduces production to introduce new cars and trucks. SQN##389668##TIMES MIRROR PLANS MORE CUTS Times Mirror will cut 1,000 more jobs, mainly at The Los Angeles Times. It will also close its consumer multimedia group and reduce its investment in cable television. The moves mark a broad retreat from its strategy of becoming a multimedia power.

"55398","BUSINESS SUMMARY FRONT PAGE SQN##126578##OUT OF A CRISIS, AN OPPORTUNITY Goodyear is one of many big American companies in Mexico that have compensated for the collapse of domestic demand by sending goods abroad, to the United States most of all. As the peso shriveled in value, these companies saw their labor costs, in dollars, fall by more than a third. The resulting flood into the United States of cheaper autos, televisions and other products, including tires, is turning last year's $1.4 billion trade surplus with Mexico into a $15 billion deficit.  SQN##123587##BALTIMORE GAS AND POTOMAC ELECTRIC AGREE TO $2.9 BILLION MERGER In the utility industry's continuing move to cut costs and prepare for greater competition, two major East Coast companies, the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company and the Potomac Electric Power Company, announced plans for a merger yesterday that would create the nation's ninth-largest power company. The merger, one of the biggest announced so far in the industry, would create a new company serving 1.8 million electric and 530,000 gas customers in the Baltimore-Washington area. SQN##129836##G.O.P. WANTS I.R.S. TO USE BILL COLLECTORS Congressional Republicans are poised to pass legislation requiring the Internal Revenue Service to turn over some debt collection to commercial interests, thereby giving certain private citizens access to confidential taxpayer information for the first time. The agency's appropriations bill, now stalled in a Senate-House conference over an unrelated issue, would provide $13 million for the I.R.S. to test whether private bill collectors could do a better job than the agency's own employees, even though they would be denied such governmental powers as the ability to seize property. SQN##122033##BANK DEALS: ASKING CASH IN MERGERS DOESN'T PAY These days most bank deals are simply swaps of paper; the acquirer trades its shares to the stockholders of the target company. Doing deals entirely with stock allows banks to use a more favorable accounting treatment, known as pooling of interests -- which lets banks avoid having to reconcile on their books the fact that they bought a company for far more than its accounting book value. Buying companies for cash, or buying any subsidiary of another company must be accounted for as a purchase requiring the buyer to write off the good will -- the difference between the purchase price and the target's book value -- over 15 years.

"60452","BUSINESS SUMMARYFRONT PAGE F.A.A. STRUGGLES WITH BUDGET PRESSURE Years behind schedule in modernizing air traffic control equipment and struggling to keep order in the crowded skies, the Federal Aviation Administration is facing a Congress that demands it do better in the future with a budget billions of dollars smaller, even as air traffic is expected to grow sharply. Corporate executives say an improved F.A.A. system would reduce travel  delays and produce huge gains in productivity. TWO VIEWS ON A TAX CREDIT Senate Republicans say their plan to limit a tax credit for the working poor will save $42 billion by 2002. But families who use the credit say it has done what it was intended to do: make their lives more manageable. THE NEW WATCHDOGS OF DIGITAL COMMERCE Crusading graduate-student hackers from the University of California at Berkeley are following the hacker subculture's time-honored tradition of ferreting out and publicizing imperfections in the endless quest for software perfection. But  representing a new generation of the computer crusader tradition that seems more vigilant than vigilante, the Berkeley crusaders may typify a new willingness to  accommodate Big Business on the Internet -- as long as Big Business isn't trying to dupe the public with technology that is not as safe or secure as advertised.  THE SPOTLIGHT AGAIN TURNS TO MICROSOFT For technology investors, the really big shoe falls tomorrow, when the Microsoft Corporation reports its first-quarter financial results.

And the answer, when it comes, will  resound well beyond Microsoft. Market Place BOOK DEALS: LOSING NOTHING IN TRANSLATION By providing a forum where publishers can market their books to other publishers, the annual Frankfurt Book Fair enables publishers in the United State to pick up hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars in revenue from sales of foreign rights. And the extra revenue made here can make a marked  difference in a book's profitability.

"60541","BUSINESS SUMMARY FRONT PAGE SQN##363979##FED ARRANGES WITH JAPAN TO ACT IN EVENT OF CRISIS The Federal Reserve, worried about the financial health of Japanese banks, has arranged with Japanese financial authorities to provide billions of dollars almost instantly in exchange for Treasury securities in a sudden cash crisis. The Fed has bought huge amounts of Treasury securities in past crises, but the agreement appears to be its first effort to guard against a possible crisis. SQN##369071##THE STANDOFF OVER BEEF Cattle ranchers and feedlot operators are mired in one of their worst slumps ever while meatpackers are earning what analysts estimate are record profits. Although cattle producers and meatpackers agree that ranchers have too many cattle to sell, some producers and agribusiness critics are questioning whether more than simple market forces are at work with regard to the meatpackers' big profits. SQN##364878##PRIVATIZING IN HUNGARY: A DOOR REOPENS Over the last year it has been hard lately to take privatization in Hungary seriously. But now global players in oil and gas, electricity and telecommunications are convinced that the country is at last getting serious about privatizing its largest companies; for Hungary has put up for sale the crown jewels -- its oil company, its electricity- and gas-distribution industry, its major banks and a second stock installment in the state telephone company, Matav. SQN##365092##INTEL'S PROFIT MEASURES UP ON WALL ST. The Intel Corporation rewarded the faithful yesterday with a 41.3 percent rise in third-quarter earnings, meeting or exceeding most analysts' estimates. The news of Intel's profit, combined with the report of inordinate earnings at Sun Microsystems Inc., could set the stage today for a renewed technology stock rally.  SQN##364401##TJX WILL BUY MARSHALLS CHAIN FROM MELVILLE  The Melville Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to sell its faltering Marshalls division to the TJX Companies for $550 million in cash and stock. The deal, analysts said, would provide some needed consolidation in the fiercely competitive discount clothing business.
