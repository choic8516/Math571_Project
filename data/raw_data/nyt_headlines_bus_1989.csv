"87070","Starts in Housing Show 12% Rebound for October WASHINGTON, Nov. 17 (AP) -Housing starts bounced back by 12 percent in October from September's seven-year low, the Commerce Department reported today.   Analysts said they expected the construction rate to remain stable through the first quarter of 1990.   ''The housing market seems to have bottomed out,'' said David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders. But he and other analysts said they did not expect any surge in building.   The Commerce Department reported that new homes and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.42 million units last month.  Drops in Previous Two Months     The 12 percent rebound from September was the sharpest gain since a 13 percent advance in December 1986. Starts had fallen 4.6 percent in September and 6.4 percent in August.   Although September's pace was revised upward from the 1.26 million reported earlier, it was still the most sluggish since new homes and apartments were built at an annual rate of 1.17 million units in October 1982 during the depths of a recession.   Many analysts attributed the September construction drop to a rise in mortgage rates and said the October gain followed a subsequent decline.   The housing industry has been among the hardest hit as the Federal Reserve drove up interest rates to slow economic growth and lower inflation. But the Fed has slowly eased rates over the summer and, except for the blip in September, rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages have fallen from March's 11.22 percent peak to 9.82 percent by the end of October, according to surveys by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.  Decline in Inventories     The higher rates stifled sales and bolstered inventories of single-family homes to an 8.1-month supply by last March, said Richard Peach, an economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association. As rates have fallen, he added, inventories have dropped to a six-month supply, which, he said, ''by historical standards'' puts the industry ''in good shape.''   But even though many analysts expect mortgage rates to drop another half of a percentage point in coming months, Mr. Peach said he did not expect a sharp rise in building.   Construction of single-family homes in October rose 6.9 percent, to an annual rate of 1.03 million units. Single-family starts had fallen 3 percent in September and 3.5 percent in August.   Apartment construction rose 28 percent in October, to an annual rate of 393,000 units. It had fallen 9.4 percent in September after dropping 14 percent in August.   Total housing starts during the first 10 months of the year were down 6 percent from the corresponding period of 1988.   The South, which posted a 14.7 drop for the steepest regional decline in September, turned in the sharpest increase in October, up by 17.1 percent, to 562,000 units. It was followed by the Midwest with a 16.5 percent gain, to 289,000 units.   Construction rose 6 percent in the Northeast, to 176,000 units, and 5.1 percent in the West, to 393,000 units.",NA,"Business","1989-11-18"

"95058","THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Margeotes Maintains An Allure CREATIVE people are a fickle lot, always seeking the next set of hot agencies and sending out their collected oeuvre of ads, hoping for a look-see, an interview and maybe a job. These days, the resumes of creative people seem to be arriving with great frequency at Margeotes Fertitta & Weiss.   The artistry of its print advertising for clients like Remy Martin liqueurs, Godiva chocolates and Harper's Bazaar magazine certainly tends to lure wandering creative souls. The agency's art directors seem to sculpture images on pages using light and shadow as tools.   But even more attractive is that Margeotes seems to be a tranquil island in a sea of agency mergers, client defections and executive resignations. This despite the loss earlier in the year of Oldsmobile's Tri-State Marketing Group - the ''Good Olds Guys'' - after a tenure of barely six months.   ''We hardly ever lose business,'' said the agency's co-founder, president and chief executive, George A. Fertitta. ''Godiva has been with us for 12 years; Remy Martin, seven years; Bankers Trust, six years; Orrefors crystal has been here six years.''   But the greatest appeal may lie simply in that ineluctable thing called culture. The agency, just down the block from the Public Theater and next door to the Cheyenne Social Club in downtown Manhattan, is a happy place, and Mr. Fertitta is a buoyant man.   He says he has never felt constrained by the way agencies do things because, when he formed the agency in 1973 with John Margeotes, who is now retired, he had worked in advertising only six months. (The name of John Weiss was added when he joined the agency several months later.) While Mr. Fertitta was building the agency to about $80 million in billings, he insisted that one of its three rules for employment be that ''people love themselves.'' Inside his agency, he added, ''there's a lot of laughter - a lot of crying.''   While one could easily dismiss Mr. Fertitta's touchy/feely commentary as New Age hokum, he is too ingenuous to disbelieve. The staff banter and informal tone of the agency reinforce what he says: A stairwell is decorated with a painting executed by a local grafitti artist; staff members have access to a small ''reading room'' where magazines are strewn on blue-and-white canvas beach chairs and starch-white wooden tables topped by umbrellas.   With his shaggy brown hair, smooth complexion and voice that erupts frequently into boyish shouts, Mr. Fertitta not only looks younger than his 43 years, but he seems barely older than the twentysomethings who populate his agency.   ''She just had a baby and came back,'' he said, pointing to one employee. He stopped by an office where two women were chating: ''And she just had a baby,'' he said, glancing at one while the the other shot him a funny smile. ''Not you,'' he shouted. ''If you're pregnant, I'll kill you! You told me you wouldn't do that for two years!'' He laughed. She laughed.   That kind of chemistry has created an effective compound. The agency says it has grown about 30 percent a year for the last several years. Judy Wald, a leading ad agency creative recruiter, lists Margeotes with Korey, Kay & Partners, Goldsmith/ Jeffrey, Angotti, Thomas, Hedge and Berenter Greenhouse & Webster as the hot creative shops currently.   Alice Magdol-Conrad, another advertising executive recruiter, said Margeotes has ''proven they can compete in the mainstream with major agencies.'' Its success, she said, stems from its ability to attract business from major companies, including a confidential assignment from the General Foods Corporation.   ''That differentiates it from other small shops that may get pieces of business from small companies,'' Ms. Magdol-Conrad said. Because of its success in luring widely known clients, she said, and because, unlike many creative boutiques, it has demonstrated prowess in television as well as print advertising, ''it is a shop that can attract people who are not normally attractable to small agencies.''   Indeed, the media director of Margeotes, Susan Nanfeldt, came from Ogilvy & Mather; the director of account services, Don Maurer, was at BBDO, and the co-creative director, Jeff Weiss, worked six years at J. Walter Thompson.   Mr. Fertitta has a term for what drew them: ''Naive freshness,'' he called it. ''It works in our favor.''",NA,"Business","1989-12-19"

"95833","Spurt in Travel Abroad Cuts Japan's Large Trade Surplus After fruitless years of struggling with Japan to negotiate down its yawning trade surpluses, foreign governments are getting help from an unlikely source: 10 million Japanese with a passion for overseas travel.   With all those yen and dollars being spent offshore as Japanese ''import'' hotel lodging, restaurant meals and myriad other travel services, Japan's financial surpluses are shrinking quickly, even while many thorny trade issues remain unresolved.   ''To our surprise, travel services have become Japan's second-largest 'import,' after oil,'' said Koji Watanabe, the deputy minister for foreign affairs and a top official representing Japan in current trade negotiations with the United States. Travel, Mr. Watanabe added, represents ''one of the most promising areas for Japan to increase its imports.'' A Large Travel Deficit    In the first nine months of this year, Japan ran a $14.5 billion travel deficit, meaning that is how much more Japanese travelers spent overseas than foreign travelers spent in Japan. With a year-end surge beginning - travel agents estimate that a half-million Japanese will go abroad for the holidays - the Government expects the deficit to top $20 billion for the year. That would more than double the $8.7 billion travel deficit in 1987 and would represent a fivefold increase from the $3.7 billion gap in 1985.   The total of 10 million overseas travelers includes both tourists and people on business trips and is nearly double the level of three years ago. Some experts maintain that the figures would be much higher were it not for serious bottlenecks at Japan's undersized, overburdened international airports, which can make overseas travel an ordeal.   ''Not only are people spending these huge amounts on travel, but they all bring back lots of omiyage,'' said Susumo Saito, chief economist here for a unit of Credit Suisse, using the Japanese word for gifts. ''The cumulative amounts have been getting very big,'' Mr. Saito said.   The typical Japanese tourist will go abroad for six to seven days, spending $1,750 on travel and an additional $1,000 or so on goods, according to the Japan Travel Bureau, the nation's largest travel agent.   The favorite destinations are in the Pacific Rim. More than a million Japanese visited Hawaii last year, and a similar number also traveled to South Korea and to Hong Kong.   Japan's travel deficit with the United States alone represented more than a third of its worldwide travel gap in 1988. This year, a growing number of young Japanese are booking trips to New York and San Francisco, Japanese travel agents say.   Just why the Government and economists are taking notice is clear from the impact the travel boom is having on Japan's current account, the broadest measure of a nation's trade performance with the rest of the world, including trade in both goods and services.   In the first 10 months of this year, Japan's current-account surplus shrank in dollar terms by 23.5 percent, to $48.6 billion, from the period a year earlier. Government economists now predict that for the full year the current-account surplus could be less than $60 billion, well under the $71 billion forecast earlier and down sharply from the peak of $87 billion in 1987. Would Slow Rise in Wealth    To be sure, there are many frictions between the United States and Japan that a reduction in the current-account surplus would not solve. These include American assertions that Japanese markets remain closed to items like semiconductors, wood products, supercomputers and satellites. But a sustained decline in the current-account surplus would slow Japan's extraordinary accumulation of wealth in recent years.   In the arithmetic of trade figures, the travel deficit is part of the ledger dealing with ''invisible trade,'' which includes services, fees, royalties and investment income. The other part of the ledger concerns merchandise, or ''visible,'' trade. Most of the negotiations between the United States and Japan have been over the merchandise trade balance.   A declining Japanese current-account surplus could have a significant impact on Japan's purchasing power abroad, reducing its investment in the United States on everything from real estate to Treasury bonds and hampering the competitiveness of Japanese banks overseas.   ''This is why you hear the Japanese Government talking a lot more about the current account than the visible trade balance, where there hasn't been as much progress,'' said Kenneth S. Courtis, senior economist here for Deutsche Bank. ''And the travel deficit is behind it.''   Some economists agree with Mr. Watanabe that the travel boom could do more to shrink Japan's capital surpluses than all the measures being planned for increasing the country's imports and opening its markets to foreign goods. 'An Enormous New Market'    ''What people are starting to realize is that this is not just a change for Japanese consumers, but is changing consumption around the world because of how much Japanese tourists are spending overseas,'' Mr. Courtis said. ''You have some 10 million high spenders going abroad each year. It's an enormous new market that is going to continue to grow.''   On the front lines of this new army of travelers, life can be hectic. Takeshi Saito, manager of the overseas sales department for the bustling Shinjuku office of the Japan Travel Bureau, said his office's sales had more than doubled this year from 1988.   As young people nearby studied pamphlets for package trips to Australia, Hawaii and Europe, Mr. Saito noted that he had increased his staff by 30 percent to keep up with the demand. He pointed out that domestic travel has also boomed. A Different Tourist Now    Along with the boom is a change in the tourist, reflecting Japan's growing self-confidence. The days of Japanese travel groups moving through museums, hotels, restaurants and stores in lockstep, wearing the same tour hats, carrying the official tour bags and following a flag-waving tour leader also seem to be ending.   ''No more hats, no more bags,'' Mr. Saito said. ''Things have changed 100 percent. Especially the younger people. They want more free time when they get someplace.''   Many Japanese who make up the country's roving army of frequent fliers had to be forced as recently as two years ago to take Saturdays off and use their vacation time.   The Japanese Government lent its rhetorical support to the new spirit. Three years ago it declared its ''10 million plan,'' an effort to cajole that many Japanese to travel abroad. But the Government took almost no practical steps to raise interest in travel. Nonetheless, and to everyone's surprise, the goal has been met two years earlier than hoped.   Japan enforced rigorous travel restrictions in the postwar years to keep the nation's precious capital resources at home and to help rebuild the economy. 'Saved All the Time'    ''People were used to being conservative and saved all the time because the Government told them it was necessary,'' said Manabu Kanematsu, president of the Japan Association of Travel Agents, a trade group. ''But when they heard the Government, even the prime minister, encouraging them to use their savings and to travel, people really became more positive, more relaxed.''   Mr. Kanematsu also said that overseas travel has become a way for Japanese, whose living standard at home has been stunted by dauntingly high costs for housing and luxury goods, to begin to feel the wealth they had been reading about.   ''People who live in the smallest houses here want the biggest hotel rooms when they travel overseas,'' Mr. Kanematsu said.  The Japanese travel boom appears to have a great deal of room for growth. Compared with people in many other industrialized countries, Japanese are still homebodies. Britain, for example, with less than half the population of Japan, has three times as many overseas travelers.   ''They're way behind other countries,'' Mr. Courtis said. ''I think we can still expect a lot of catching up.''",NA,"Front Page; Travel; Business","1989-12-22"
